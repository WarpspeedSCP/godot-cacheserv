# godot-cacheserv
Cache server module for godot engine

This module was made as part of the Google Summer of Code 2019 program. The purpose of this module is to allow Godot engine to shift from using OS based caching for any IO to its own caching, relying only on fast unbuffered IO on the OS side. This allows for ease of use within costrained environments such as game consoles and other limited hardware.

[Here][1] is a list of all the commits I've made during the project time period.

I've also made a [technical document][2] that attempts to explain how everything works.

# Current state

As of the time of writing this document, the core functionality of this module is present. However, there are some bugs which must be resolved to make the module usable.

The main blocking bug is with the read mechanism: the read operation may read fewer bytes than specified. I am still investigating the cause of this bug.

# Installation

This is an engine module for the Godot engine, and is intended to be used in the engine as a drop-in module at compile-time.

* First, retrieve the Godot engine source code from the Godot engine main [repo](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).
* Navigate to the modules folder.
* Execute the following command: ``` $ git clone https://github.com/WarpspeedSCP/godot-cacheserv cacheserv```

The module should now be present in the cacheserv subdirectory and will automatically be included when the engine is built.

# Usage

This module exposes one type intended for generaal use: the `FileAccessCached` class. This class provides a FileAccess style frontend to the file cache server which does all the heavy file IO. `FileAccessCached` is available through both GDScript and C++.
